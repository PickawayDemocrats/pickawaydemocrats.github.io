# NOTICE OF A SPECIAL MEETING

# MONDAY, JULY 31, 2023 5:30PM

# PICKAWAY COUNTY LIBRARY

 

The Pickaway County Democratic Party will be holding a special meeting to nominate a recommended replacement for a recently vacated seat on the Pickaway County Board of Elections.

Any Democrat in the county who is nominated by a member of the party Executive Committee may be considered for this position. 

The selection of our recommended representative will be by a simple majority vote of members of the Pickaway County Democratic Party Executive Committee present at the meeting.

This recommendation will be submitted as a recommendation to the Pickaway County Board of Elections and ultimately to the Ohio Secretary of State for appointment to fill the position for the unexpired term of Karen Bensonhaver.

<h2 class="title is-3 horizontal-line">
May 2025 Primary Election
</h2>
<h3>Candidates</h3>

<strong>There will be no candidates appearing as a Democrat on the ballot in Pickaway County for 2025.</strong><br>
While there are nine partisan offices in Circleville, and the Municipal Court Judge (partisan primary, non-partisan election) up for election this year, nobody wanted to run as a Democrat. Of those nine partisan offices in Circleville, there is one Republican running unopposed for every seat except for 1st Ward Council, which is a two-way contest for the nomination. If you are interested in running as an independent for one of these partisan offices, the petition deadline is May 5th.

Circleville offices up for election:<br>
 * Municipal Judge 
 * City Council President 
 * Treasurer 
 * 3x City Council Member - At-Large 
 * 4x City Council Member - Ward 

There will be other offices up for election on November 4th, but all are non-partisan elections. If you want to run for a non-partisan office, the petition deadline is August 6th.

<h3>Issues</h3> 
School district issues will only appear on your ballot if you are in the appropriate school district. <br>

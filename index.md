Haven House Holiday
</h2>
<div class="is-size-4">Thursday, December 7th, 2023 5:30PM to 8:00PM</div><br>

This holiday season, you are invited to honor and celebrate a Pickaway County treasure of caring and support -- join us for our second annual Haven House Holiday!<br>

Good food, good cheer and good work as the community comes together to provide for our sisters in a time of need.<br>

Join us for an open house at the Hartley Home, 5 miles East of Circleville just off SR 188. Stop by to share in the joy and meaning of the season as we gather needed items. Financial donations are also welcome.

Thank you for your interest in the Pickaway County Democratic
Scholarship Club Program. Our scholarship program is intended to expand
your ability to engage in and improve communities. The application will be
based on submission of a project that describes your concept of engaging
with democracy and community.

Your application will enter you in an opportunity for a one-time scholarship
award of $300. This scholarship can be applied to developmental learning
experiences after graduation from high school.

Do you have a special interest you would like to pursue with further learning?
Going off to college or trade school? Any of these will qualify you enter to
receive one of these competitive awards.

This is the first annual <b>ENGAGE FOR THE FUTURE</b> scholarship award. One non-
partisan scholarship will be awarded to a high school senior in each of the four
public school systems in Pickaway County. Each award will be for $300 and
can be applied to a formal learning situation of your choice.
This may be, for example; art classes, ceramics classes, college tuition, music
lessons, horseback riding lessons, tech school tuition, guitar lessons, master
gardener training, fitness training, chef school, etc. As part of the application
process the intended use of the funds will be specified. Funds will be issued
directly to the organization/school you identified in your application on your
behalf. You will be contacted 6 months after the award to give us a report on
your experience.

<span class="title is-5">Background of ENGAGE FOR THE FUTURE Scholarship Program</span>

The Pickaway County Democratic Party understands that young people
coming of age as members of the voting population in the United States
of America and the state of Ohio are the future of democracy. This
program is intended to encourage high school seniors to reflect upon
ways to improve and strengthen their communities, and the positive
impact one individual can have. Democracy is enhanced when people,
especially young people, register and vote when eligible.
The application will be based on submission of a project that describes
the applicant’s concept of engaging with democracy and community.
Winners will be announced as part of the school end-of-year honors
program. All entrants will be recognized with a letter and certificate.
Pickaway County Democratic Party reserves the right to use the project
or excerpts from the project in our social media and/or promotional
materials. If used in such a manner, credit and acknowledgement will be
given to the author/creator.

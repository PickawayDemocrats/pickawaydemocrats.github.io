<span class="title is-5">Background of ENGAGE FOR THE FUTURE Scholarship Program</span>

The Pickaway County Democratic Party understands that young people
coming of age as members of the voting population in the United States
of America and the state of Ohio are the future of democracy. This
program is intended to encourage high school seniors to reflect upon
ways to improve and strengthen their communities, and the positive
impact one individual can have. Democracy is enhanced when people,
especially young people, register and vote when eligible.
The application will be based on submission of a project that describes
the applicant’s concept of engaging with democracy and community.
Winners will be announced as part of the school end-of-year honors
program. All entrants will be recognized with a letter and certificate.
Pickaway County Democratic Party reserves the right to use the project
or excerpts from the project in our social media and/or promotional
materials. If used in such a manner, credit and acknowledgement will be
given to the author/creator.
